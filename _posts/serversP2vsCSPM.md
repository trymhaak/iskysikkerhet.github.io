# Unlocking the Full Potential of Cloud Security: Defender for Servers Plan 2 vs. Defender CSPM
When building a cloud security strategy, understanding the strengths of each tool in your arsenal is critical. Two powerful solutions from Microsoft Defender stand out: Defender for Servers Plan 2 and Defender CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management). But how do they differ, and what can you gain by leveraging both?

## What Defender for Servers Plan 2 Offers

Defender for Servers Plan 2 focuses on securing workloads with advanced protection for virtual machines (VMs) and Kubernetes nodes. Key features include:

- **Agentless Vulnerability Scanning**: Detect vulnerabilities on VMs without requiring agents.
- **Threat Detection**: Monitor OS-level and network-level behaviors for malicious activities.
- **Integration with Defender for Endpoint**: Extend security to endpoints with attack surface reduction, EDR, and advanced hunting.
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Identify unauthorized changes to critical files and registries.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Compare workload configurations against industry standards.

This solution is ideal for organizations prioritizing workload security and endpoint protection in their cloud environments.

## What’s Exclusive to Defender CSPM?

While Defender for Servers Plan 2 is workload-focused, Defender CSPM elevates security by addressing the entire cloud posture. Here’s what makes Defender CSPM stand out:

### Cloud Security Posture Management

- **AI-Driven Insights**: Gain actionable recommendations to enhance your security posture.
- **Internet Exposure Analysis**: Detect cloud resources exposed to the internet and mitigate risks.
- **External Attack Surface Management**: Assess your environment from an attacker’s perspective.

### Advanced Risk Management

- **Attack Path Analysis**: Visualize potential attack vectors across your cloud assets.
- **Risk Hunting**: Explore and prioritize risks with powerful tools like Security Explorer.

### DevOps Integration

- **Code-to-Cloud Mapping**: Track applications from repositories (GitHub, Azure DevOps) to deployment.
- **Pull Request Annotations**: Embed security insights directly into development workflows.

### Governance & Data Security

- **Permissions Management (CIEM)**: Enforce least-privilege access across multicloud environments.
- **Sensitive Data Protection**: Manage and secure sensitive data across Azure, AWS, and GCP.

## Why Both Are Better Together

While Defender for Servers Plan 2 ensures robust protection for workloads, Defender CSPM broadens the scope with multicloud visibility, advanced risk prioritization, and DevOps integration. Together, they provide a comprehensive cloud security strategy that covers both workload-level protection and posture management.

Whether you’re focused on workload security, cloud governance, or bridging the gap between DevOps and security, these solutions offer unparalleled benefits. Ready to unlock the full potential of cloud security? Start by understanding where these tools fit into your organization’s strategy.
