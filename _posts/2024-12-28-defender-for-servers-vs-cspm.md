  description: "Compare Defender for Servers Plans 1 & 2 and CSPM. Learn how to balance regulatory compliance with cost-effective strategies for cloud security."
---

Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 1, Plan 2, and Defender CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) offer robust options to secure cloud environments. Plan 1 focuses on essential endpoint detection and response (EDR), Plan 2 provides advanced workload protection, and CSPM delivers posture management and governance, especially for multicloud environments.

This guide explores features, overlaps, pricing, and how to optimize costs by strategically combining or prioritizing these tools.

## Did You Know?  

Defender CSPM (paid version) only incurs charges for subscriptions with billable resources (e.g., VMs, databases, or storage accounts). Deploying it in resource-free subscriptions allows you to access features like Defender for DevOps at no additional cost.

## Feature Comparison

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Focus**         | Essential EDR for workloads     | Advanced workload security      | Basic posture management     | Advanced multicloud posture governance    |
| **Agentless Scanning**    | No                              | VMs and Kubernetes nodes        | Not included                 | Multicloud resources (VMs, storage, DBs)  |
| **Endpoint Detection**    | Yes (via Defender for Endpoint) | Yes (via Defender for Endpoint) | No                           | No                                        |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Limited                         | Comprehensive (e.g., MCSB)      | Basic standards (e.g., MCSB) | Advanced support (CIS, NIST, etc.)        |
| **Threat Detection**      | EDR only                        | OS- and network-level           | No                           | Attack path analysis, risk prioritization |
| **Pricing**               | $4.906/server/month             | $14.60/server/month             | Free                         | $5.11/resource/month (billable assets)    |

## Pricing Breakdown  

### Defender for Servers Plan 1  

- **Cost:** $4.906/server/month.  
- **Example:** 100 servers = **$490.60/month**.

### Defender for Servers Plan 2  

- **Cost:** $14.60/server/month.  
- **Example:** 100 servers = **$1,460/month**.

### CSPM  

- **Free Version:** $0.  
- **Paid Version:** $5.11/resource/month.  
- **Example:** 50 VMs + 20 storage accounts + 10 databases = 80 resources = **$408.80/month**.

## When to Choose Each Option  

### Defender for Servers Plan 1

- **Best For:**  
  - Basic endpoint detection and response (EDR).  
  - Organizations with smaller budgets focusing on EDR over advanced features.  
- **Limitations:** No agentless scanning or advanced threat detection.

### Defender for Servers Plan 2  

- **Best For:**  
  - Critical workloads needing advanced protection.  
  - Features like file integrity monitoring and agentless scanning.  
- **Limitations:** Higher per-server cost.

### CSPM Free  

- **Best For:**  
  - Posture management and compliance without advanced scanning needs.  
  - Resource-free subscriptions where governance is still required.

### CSPM Paid  

- **Best For:**  
  - Multicloud environments needing advanced governance and regulatory alignment.  
  - Organizations requiring compliance with standards like CIS, NIST, and PCI-DSS.  
  - Advanced features like attack path analysis and DevOps integration.  
- **Unique Advantage:** Supports detailed alignment with multiple compliance frameworks across Azure, AWS, and GCP.

## Cost-Saving Opportunities  

1. **Combine Plans Strategically:**  
   - Use Plan 1 for basic EDR and upgrade only critical workloads to Plan 2.  
   - Deploy CSPM Free in resource-free subscriptions for no-cost posture management.

2. **Optimize Deployment:**  
   - Use Plan 2 selectively for workloads needing agentless scanning and threat detection.  
   - Use CSPM Paid for multicloud governance and regulatory compliance.

## Example Scenarios  

### Scenario 1: Small Business (Single Cloud) 

- **Environment:** 50 Azure VMs, 10 Azure databases.  
- **Recommended Tools:**  
  - Defender for Servers Plan 1 for basic EDR.  
  - CSPM Free for posture management.  
- **Cost:**  
  - Plan 1: $4.906 x 50 = **$245.30/month**.  
  - CSPM Free: **$0**.

### Scenario 2: Mid-Sized Business (Critical Workloads)

- **Environment:** 100 Azure VMs (20 critical), 20 Azure databases.  
- **Recommended Tools:**  
  - Defender for Servers Plan 2 for critical workloads.  
  - CSPM Free for posture management.  
- **Cost:**  
  - Plan 2 (20 VMs): $14.60 x 20 = **$292/month**.  
  - CSPM Free: **$0**.

### Scenario 3: Enterprise (Multicloud Environment)  

- **Environment:** 200 VMs (Azure, AWS), 50 storage accounts, 20 databases.  
- **Recommended Tools:**  
  - CSPM Paid for multicloud governance and regulatory compliance.  
  - Defender for Servers Plan 2 for critical Azure workloads.  
- **Cost:**  
  - CSPM Paid: (200 VMs + 50 storage accounts + 20 databases) x $5.11 = **$1,377.70/month**.  
  - Plan 2 (50 Azure VMs): $14.60 x 50 = **$730/month**.

## Conclusion  

By leveraging Defender for Servers Plans 1 or 2 alongside CSPM Free or Paid, organizations can create a tailored, cost-effective security strategy. Enterprises needing compliance with CIS, NIST, or PCI-DSS can rely on CSPM Paid for advanced governance, while smaller setups can maximize value with CSPM Free and selective use of Plan 1 or 2.
