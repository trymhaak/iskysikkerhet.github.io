## Defender for Servers Plan 2 vs. CSPM: Overlaps, Pricing, and Cost Savings

Microsoft Defender for Servers Plan 2 and Defender CSPM (Cloud Security Posture Management) are key tools in cloud security. While they cater to different priorities—workload protection versus multicloud governance—they share overlapping features. For organizations looking to cut costs, understanding these overlaps is essential.

### NB: Did You Know?

Defender CSPM only incurs charges for subscriptions with billable resources (e.g., VMs, databases, or storage accounts). Deploying it in resource-free subscriptions allows you to access features like Defender for DevOps at no additional cost.

### Key Comparison: Defender for Servers Plan 2 vs. CSPM

| Feature                   | Defender for Servers Plan 2 | Defender CSPM                             |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**                 | Workload-specific security  | Multicloud posture management             |
| **Agentless Scanning**    | VMs and Kubernetes nodes    | Multicloud resources (VMs, storage, DBs)  |
| **Regulatory Compliance** | Workload-level (e.g., MCSB) | Broad multicloud compliance               |
| **Threat Detection**      | OS and network-level        | Attack path analysis, risk prioritization |
| **Pricing**               | $14.60/server/month         | $5.11/resource/month                      |

### Pricing Breakdown

**Defender for Servers Plan 2:**  
- $14.60/server/month.  
- Example: 100 servers = **$1,460/month**.

**Defender CSPM:**  
- $5.11/resource/month for billable assets.  
- Example: 50 VMs + 20 storage accounts + 10 databases = 80 resources = **$408.80/month**.

### Overlaps and Cost-Saving Opportunities

#### Vulnerability Scanning

- **Servers Plan 2:** Covers workloads (VMs, Kubernetes).  
- **CSPM:** Extends scanning across multicloud environments.  
**Tip:** Use CSPM if scanning across all assets suffices.

#### Regulatory Compliance

- Both tools align with standards like MCSB.  
**Tip:** Choose Servers Plan 2 for workload-focused compliance.

#### Threat Detection

- **Servers Plan 2:** OS- and network-level monitoring.  
- **CSPM:** Prioritizes attack paths and critical risks.  
**Tip:** Rely on CSPM for broader threat management.

### Choosing the Right Solution

**When to Use Defender for Servers Plan 2:**

- You need OS-level protection for VMs or Kubernetes.
- Multicloud governance isn’t a priority.

**When to Use Defender CSPM:**

- You manage resources across Azure, AWS, and GCP.
- Your focus is on posture management and governance.

**When to Use Both:**

- You have critical workloads needing deep protection alongside multicloud governance.

---

### Cost-Saving Strategies

1. **Audit Security Needs:** Identify workloads requiring OS-level protection versus posture management.
2. **Use Foundational CSPM:** Start with CSPM’s free tier for compliance and recommendations.
3. **Targeted Deployment:** Deploy Servers Plan 2 only for workloads that need advanced security.
4. **Monitor Billing:** Track usage and adjust plans to avoid paying for unused features.

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Small Business (50 VMs, 10 Databases)

- **Servers Plan 2:** $14.60 x 50 = **$730/month**.  
- **CSPM:** $5.11 x 60 = **$306.60/month**.  
**Savings:** Switching to CSPM saves **$423.40/month**.

#### Scenario 2: Enterprise (100 VMs, 50 Storage Accounts, 20 Databases)

- **Servers Plan 2:** $14.60 x 100 = **$1,460/month**.  
- **CSPM:** $5.11 x 170 = **$867.70/month**.  
**Recommendation:** Combine both for workload-specific security and governance.
